## Notebook Translation

The example notebooks provided in this repository are primarily written in **Portuguese**, as the package was originally designed for educational use in Brazil. However, **all function names, arguments, and API calls are in English**, ensuring full compatibility for international users.

If you would like to translate the notebooks into your preferred language, you can use tools such as:

- [jupyter-translate](https://github.com/WittmannF/jupyter-translate): A JupyterLab extension that adds automatic translation (powered by DeepL or Google Translate) to notebook cells. Highly recommended.
- Browser-based translation plugins, such as Google Translate.
- Export notebooks to `.md` with `nbconvert`, translate them using any translation tool, and re-import with `jupytext`.

> Note: Print messages and debug output (e.g., when `debug=True`) are also in Portuguese, but do not affect functionality. For detailed usage instructions and English docstrings, refer to [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).
